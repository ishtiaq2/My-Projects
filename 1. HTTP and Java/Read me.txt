Note: Not final, still under develope and may change and also may look vague.

The purpose of this project is to analyse HTTP protocol.

This project is developed into steps.
Step 1: HttpServer listening on port:8080, and reads the request line + header data sent by the browser.
	The first step is to see the data and format of the data sent by Client (usually a web browser).

Step 2: Sent a message to the client and display it on the browser UI.


Step 3: The third step is to make an HttpServer to handle multiple clients with an ID and compute long running processes on a separate thread
(using ForkJoinPool, so that we can return to the main thread after reading a request), and continue accepting requests indstead of waiting
for time consuming processes. It needs to be further varified (the id) by setting cookies.

The steps below are not yet covered and will be added soon.
Step 4: To make our application a RESTful web service by adding HTTP mathods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
	The application has to act on a shared Counter obj. The object has a counter (int) and name field that can be incremented with a PUT method.
	The user (browser UI) is presented with a button to increment (to perform PUT operation) counter value.

Step 5: User can create (POST), update (PUT) and delete (DELETE) their own Counter objects. 

Step 4: Single Page Application (SPA)

The Third step is to see how the client and the server uses or can use (act to use) this data. This include cookies and directory structure on client and server.

The third step is to see how different http methods (also known as REST services) could be used for communication. This include the format of data exchanged between the client and the server.

The fourth step is to connect to Database(MySQL).

The fifth step is to use SSL.
