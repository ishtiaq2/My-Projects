The purpose of this project is to analyse HTTP protocol.

This project is developed into steps.
Step 1: HttpServer listening on port:8080, and reads the request line + header data sent by the browser.

Step 2: Echo the data sent by the client and display it on the browser.

The first step is to see the data and format of the data exhcanged between an HTTP Server and Client (usually a web browser).

The scond step is an echo server.

The third step is to make an HttpServer to handle multiple clients with their own IDs and compute long running processes on a separate thread
(using ForkJoinPool), so that we can return to the main thread after reading a request, and continue accepting other requests indstead of waiting
for time consuming processes.

The Third step is to see how the client and the server uses or can use (act to use) this data. This include cookies and directory structure on client and server.

The third step is to see how different http methods (also known as REST services) could be used for communication. This include the format of data exchanged between the client and the server.

The fourth step is to connect to Database(MySQL).

The fifth step is to use SSL.
